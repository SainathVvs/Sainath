	 * "Selenium Webdriver works with 4 basic components: 1. Selenium Client
	 * Libraries/Language Bindings: In Selenium, There is a client library each
	 * supported languages that provides a flexibility for a user to execute the
	 * selenium commands with the user’s preferred programming language. The Client
	 * Library gives a programming interface and within those interfaces, there is a
	 * programming function that supports each selenese command. The client library
	 * takes a Selenese command and passes it to the Selenium Server for processing
	 * a specific action or test against the application under test (AUT). The
	 * client library also receives the result of that command and passes it back to
	 * your program. 2. JSON WIRE PROTOCOL over HTTP Client: JavaScript Object
	 * Notation sends the data between a server and a client on the web. JSON Wire
	 * Protocol is a REST API that transfers the information between HTTP servers.
	 * Each Browser Driver (such as FirefoxDriver, ChromeDriver etc.,) has its own
	 * HTTP server. 3. Browser Drivers: Browser drivers communicate with respective
	 * browser without revealing the internal logic of browser’s functionality. When
	 * a browser driver executes the received commands on the respective browser and
	 * the sends the response in the form of HTTP response. 4. Browsers: A web
	 * browser is a software program that allows a user to locate, access, and
	 * display web pages. In every execution, Webdriver converts each statement as a
	 * URL with the help of JSON Wire Protocol over HTTP. Every Browser Driver has a
	 * HTTP server to receive HTTP requests. Once the URL reaches the Browser
	 * Driver, then the Browser Driver will pass that request to the real browser
	 * over HTTP. Then the commands in your selenium script will be executed on the
	 * browser. "
